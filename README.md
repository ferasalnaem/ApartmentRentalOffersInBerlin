# Predict Apartment Rental using ML

This project proposes the implementation of regression models to predict apartment rents in Berlin. For this purpose, the Immoscout dataset is utilized, which contains key attributes such as living area size, rent price, location, energy type, and other relevant property characteristics.

The first phase of the project involved a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to identify characteristics with a measurable influence on rent prices and explore correlations between various attributes. In the second phase, data preprocessing as well as feature engineering is performed to clean the dataset and remove attributes with minimal impact on rent prediction.

Multiple regression techniques are implemented to predict rent prices, including:

- Linear Regression, leveraging a direct closed-form solution.
- Decision Trees, for capturing non-linear relationships.
- Ensemble Learning methods, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, to enhance prediction accuracy by combining multiple models.


By analyzing and comparing the performance of these techniques, we provide insights into their suitability and effectiveness for rental price prediction in the Berlin housing market.
